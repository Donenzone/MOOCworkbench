- Install pip3 and virtualenv if you haven't already: `sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev virtualenv`
- Set up a virtuelenv: `virtualenv -p python3 moocv`
- Activate the virtualenv: `source moocv/bin/activate`

After running the version, in order to use the social functions, you need to go to /admin and add a Social application. At least create a social app for GitHub and enter your Client ID en Client Secret key for the MOOC workbench to be able to use GitHub functionality.
