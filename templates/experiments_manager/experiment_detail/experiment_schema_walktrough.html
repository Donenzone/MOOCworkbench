<p class="lead">You have now arrived at the data schema step. In this step, you'll quickly create a data schema for the input data you've used in your experiment</p>

<h4>Step 1. Make a schema with the built-in tools</h4>
<p>Before you begin, make sure the column names in your data files adhere to the JSON Table Schema standard. Make sure the headers are alphanumeric and lowercase.
    Then, to get started run make_schema.py like this:</p>
<p>make schema input_filepath=FILEPATH_TO_DATA</p>

<h4>Step 2. Commit and push your schema</h4>
<p>If everything went right, you now have a file called schema.json in the folder schema (at the root of your project).</p>
<p>Commit and push this file to your repository</p>

<h4>Step 3. Check your schema</h4>
<p>Once you've pushed your schema, the workbench will pick it up automatically if it is valid.</p>
<p>Go to the Schema tab in your experiment to check if your schema is added already, and make changes if neccessary.</p>
